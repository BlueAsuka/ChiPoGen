 Inspired by the nanoGPT developed by Anandrej Karpathyd [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT), the same model structure is applied for training on a Chinese Poetry dataset collected in the [Chinese potery](https://github.com/Werneror/Poetry), and then used for Chinese Potery generation.

 Some generation sample is shown in the following figure:
